The bank processes thousands of transactions daily, yet currently lacks an automated solution to label transaction purposes efficiently. Without such a system, lines of business (LOBs) must assemble teams of analysts who spend close to a month manually tagging transactions with purposes. Even after this labor-intensive effort, there is no centralized repository for publishing or sharing their findings. This absence of a unified platform leads to duplicated efforts among teams addressing similar requests. Consequently, reports are often inconsistent due to multiple sources of truth, exacerbating inefficiencies and hindering operational alignment.

Furthermore, this manual process introduces a significant lag in reporting. Senior management, seeking immediate insights into sudden drops in deposits or unusual transaction patterns, cannot afford the delays caused by manual tagging. They require near real-time understanding of where funds are moving and the underlying reasons for these shifts to make timely decisions.

Our newly developed hybrid model addresses these challenges by combining business rules with machine learning to score transactions at scale and in near real-time. This dual-layer approach provides enhanced granularity and flexibility, as transactions can simultaneously have multiple purposes. For instance, a transaction originating from a Tesla account might pertain to an inventory invoice, and therefore its purposes could be classified as “Tesla,” “invoice,” and “inventory purchases.” By scoring transactions with both business rules and machine learning, the model offers richer insights, enabling LOBs and senior management to make faster, more informed decisions while eliminating inefficiencies and ensuring consistency across teams.
